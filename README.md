# Weather-Finder-Express-JS
A server side program used to detect the current weather from all around the cities. Made from Express JS API call to the OpenWeatherMap.org
OpenWeatherMap.org  have 11 different API'S that user can access. I have used the free 'Current Weather' API for this project.
API call - http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather where you have to create your own API Key and write city name in place of ${city}. For example li apiKey = '******************' and let city = 'Delhi'
